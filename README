    -I used https://github.com/kgabis/parson because it is lightweight, and I didn't need
        a lot of functionality, only needed functions to process and build jsons.

    -EXIT
        -breaks from the read command from client loop, closing the connection in the process

    -REGISTER/LOGIN
        -they have very similar behavious, so I used one function for both of them (the url and response 
            is different)
        -prompt for username and password
        -check for whitespaces
        -construct user json payload
        -send the POST request to server
        -return response from server
